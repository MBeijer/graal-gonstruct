Gonstruct
---------
Gonstruct is an unofficial level editor replacement for the Zelda-like online
game Graal Online (http://www.graalonline.com).

Compiling
---------
To compile Gonstruct from source, the following packages/tools are required:
  * gtkmm
  * gtksourceview
  * gtkglextmm
  * premake4
  * boost

You can either execute one of the build scripts (build.sh or build_release.sh)
or manually compile by executing the following commands:
  $ premake4 embed
  $ premake4 gmake
in the build directory:
  $ make gonstruct
to build the debug version, or
  $ make gonstruct config=release
to build the release version.
The result will be placed in the bin directory in either the debug or the
release folder.
